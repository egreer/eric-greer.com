			I am a Maine native who enjoys hiking, camping and <a href="/theater/">musicals</a> but get to spend most of my days infront of my computer coding all sorts of software. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and being able to create new programs.
		</p>
		<p>
			I graduated from <a href="/wpi/">WPI</a> on May 15, 2010 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Management Information Systems. I continued my education there for the 2010-2011 school year graduating with a Masters of Science Degree in Computer Science. While at WPI I worked for the technology Helpdesk which helped further my enjoyment of problem solving. I also got to spend a term in Puerto Rico working out on a boat doing ecological assesments with some pretty awesome people.

			 After college I worked for Sybase Inc. as a software engineer developing database drivers, before moving to my first startup <a href="https://media.pch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liquid Wireless</a>. At Liquid I was able to work on a advertising system that served millions of clicks / day, I got to manage the entire stack and really developed both technology chops and management skills as I eventually managed the entire technical team.
		</p>
		<p>
			In June of 2015 I left Liquid to join <a href="https://www.apsis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apsis Labs</a> where I am able to get my hands into lots of cool codebases as a consultant across a large range of web technologies.
